# Job Hub

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Libraries used
- Typescript for type checking.
- Axios for API calls.
- Tailwind and flowbite for styling.

## Issues faced
- APIs doesn't return proper real data so I have made API calls to the backend service but I am using mock data from /src/services/mockData.json to display data in frontend.

## Pages

- Home Page
